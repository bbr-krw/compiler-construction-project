# Project D: Dynamic Language

## 1. Common Description

-   **Dynamic typing**: object types are not specified and can change
    while program execution.
-   The language assumes interpretation.
-   Major notion: variable & literal (constant).
-   Program structure: a sequence of declarations and statements.

### Builtin types:

-   integer
-   real
-   boolean
-   string

### User-defined types:

-   array

-   tuple

-   function

-   Implicit type conversions are supported.

-   Statements: assignment, if/while/loop, exit/return, output.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Informal Language Specification

The program is a sequence of statements. Statements can be separated by
the semicolon character or by newline characters.

    Program : { Statement [ ; ] }

Statements execute one after the other, starting with the first in text
statement.

There are two categories of constructs: variable declaration and
statement.

Declaration of the variable introduces a new named object to the current
scope, perhaps with an initial value. Statements define a specific
action, whose semantics could consist of calculation of new value for
some variable (assignment), or changing the sequential order of
statements or of outputting values to the console.

Declaration of a variable could be in any position within the program. A
variable introduced by a declaration is considered as active within its
scope: from the point of its declaration to the end of that scope.
Within the scope, only one variable with the given name is allowed.

If a certain scope contains other (nested) scopes, then variables
declared in a nested scope may have names that match the names in the
enclosing scope. In this case, variables from the nested scope hide
variables with the same names from the enclosing scope.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Declaration

    Declaration
       : var VariableDefinition { , VariableDefinition }

    VariableDefinition
       : IDENT [ := Expression ]

When declaring a variable, you can set its initial value. The initial
value of a variable can subsequently be changed using the assignment
operator. If the initial value of the variable is not set, then it is
considered that the variable has the special value `none`. Value `none`
cannot act as an operand of operations; the only action on a variable
with this value is type checking using the `is` operation.

The type of the variable is not fixed during declaration. This means
that a variable, within its scope, can take any type of values that are
allowed in the language (see "Types"). To check the type of the current
value of a variable, there is a special unary operation `is`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Statements

The language defines a common set of statements: except for declarations
(which also have the status of statements), there are assignment,
conditional statement, two kinds of repeat statements, function return
statement, and the print statement.

    Statement
        : Declaration
        | Assignment
        | If
        | IfShort
        | Loop
        | Exit
        | Return
        | Print

### Assignment

    Assignment
        : Reference := Expression

### Conditional Statements

    If
        : if Expression then Body [ else Body ] end

    IfShort
        : if Expression => Body

    Body
        : Statement { [ ; ] Statement }

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Loops

    Loop
        : WhileLoop
        | ForLoop

### WhileLoop

    WhileLoop
        : while Expression LoopBody

### ForLoop

    ForLoop
        : [ ForHeader ] LoopBody

    ForHeader
        : for [ IDENT in ] Expression [ .. Expression ]

    LoopBody
        : loop Body end

Notice that the `ForHeader` part in the for-loop can be omitted. In that
case, the loop is infinite. The only way for exiting such a loop is the
`exit` statement.

The case with two Expressions in the loop header means that the loop
iterates over the range from `v1` until `v2`, where `v1` and `v2` are
current integer values of the corresponding expressions. If the
identifier is specified in the loop header then it introduces a variable
that takes values from the range sequentially on each loop iteration.
The scope of the variable is the loop body.

If a single Expression is specified in the loop header then its type
should be either an array or a tuple. In that case, the loop iterates
over all elements of the corresponding aggregate.

The `exit` statement can appear only within loop statements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Examples

    var i := 0
    loop // Infinite loop
        print "Hello"
        i := i + 1
        if i=100 => exit
    end

    for 1..3 loop
        print "Hello"
    end

    var array := [1,2,3,4,5]
    var sum := 0
    for i in array loop
        sum := sum+i
    end

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Return

Return statement performs leaving a function perhaps with returning a
result value to the calling context.

    Return
        : return [ Expression ]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Print

    Print
        : print Expression { , Expression }

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Expressions

Expression is a syntax construct defining an algorithm for calculating
new values. The structure of expressions is traditional and includes
several types of operands and a set of infix and prefix operations on
operands.

    Expression
        : Relation { ( or | and | xor ) Relation }

    Relation
        : Factor [ ( < | <= | > | >= | = | /= ) Factor ]

    Factor
        : Term { [ + | - ] Term }

    Term
        : Unary { ( * | / ) Unary }

    Unary
        : Reference
        | Reference is TypeIndicator
        | [ + | - | not ] Primary

    Primary
        : Literal
        | FunctionLiteral
        | ( Expression )

### TypeIndicator

    TypeIndicator
        : int
        | real
        | bool
        | string
        | none      // no type
        | [ ]       // vector type
        | { }       // tuple type
        | func      // functional type

Functions in the D language are treated as literals (similarly to
integer/real constants) in the sense that they are considered as
constant values that can be assigned to variables and passed as
arguments to other functions. The only operation defined for functions
is a call.

    FunctionLiteral
        : func [ ( IDENT { , IDENT } ) ] FunBody

    FunBody
        : is Body end
        | => Expression

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reference

The Reference production defines accessors -- constructs that specify
elementary actions with variables: taking an array element, calling a
function, and accessing elements of objects. References can be operands
of expressions, and also (this distinguishes them from other operands -
constants, subexpressions, etc.) act as recipients of values in
assignment operators.

    Reference
        : IDENT
        | Reference [ Expression ]
        | Reference ( Expression { , Expression } )
        | Reference . IDENT
        | Reference . IntegerLiteral

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Types and Literals

The language defines the values of four simple types, two composite
types, and one special type.

### Simple types

-   integer
-   real
-   string
-   boolean

Integer literals are written as a sequence of decimal digits.

Real literals are formed as two sequences of decimal digits separated by
the dot character. The first sequence denotes the integer part of the
real, the second sequence --- its fractional part.

Strings are specified as a sequence of arbitrary characters enclosed in
single or double quotes.

Boolean values are represented by two keywords `true` and `false`.

    Literal
        : INTEGER
        | REAL
        | STRING
        | Boolean
        | Tuple
        | Array
        | none

    Boolean
        : true
        | false

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Array

Array is a linear composition of values of any type. The size of the
array (number of elements) is not fixed and can be dynamically changed.
The array is presented as a list of element values, separated by commas
and enclosed in square brackets.

    Array
        : [ [ Expression { , Expression } ] ]

Access to the elements of the array is performed in the usual way: after
the name of the array in square brackets, the number of the element in
the form of an integer expression is specified. The numbering of the
elements of the array begins with one.

Note that an array is a "real" associative array with keys representing
integer values. The values of the neighboring keys in the array do not
necessarily differ by one. So, for example, the following sequence of
operators is possible:

    var t := []; // empty array declaration
    t[10] := 25;
    t[100] := func(x)=>x+1;
    t[1000] := {a:=1,b:=2.7};

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tuple

Tuple is a fixed-size collection of possibly named values of arbitrary
types. Element names, if they are specified, are unique within the
tuple. A tuple is specified as a comma-separated list of pairs of the
form `name := value`. The name and value are separated by the assignment
token `:=`. The entire list is enclosed in braces.

    Tuple
        : { TupleElement { , TupleElement } }

    TupleElement
        : [ Identifier := ] Expression

The structure of tuples, unlike arrays, cannot be modified; the only way
to change the composition of the tuple elements is to add another tuple
to it, for example:

    var t := {a:=1, b:=2, c+d};
    t := t + {e:=3}; // now t is {a:=1, b:=2, c+d, e:=3}

Access to the tuple elements is performed via dot notation, using the
name of the tuple variable and the name of the tuple element, or by
using the number of the tuple element within the tuple (numbering starts
with one), for example:

    var x := t.b; // now x is 2
    x := t.2;     // the same effect

    var y2 := t.3 // now y2 has the value of c+d

Named and unnamed elements in a tuple can follow in any order.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Operator Semantics

The semantics of expressions are generally typical of programming
languages and depend on the type of operands. Since the language is
dynamic, the control of the types of operands and the selection of the
appropriate operation algorithm is performed dynamically during program
execution.

Below is a brief description of the operations.

### Addition: `+`

-   Integer + Integer → Integer
-   Integer + Real → Real
-   Real + Integer → Real
-   Real + Real → Real
-   String + String → String (string concatenation)
-   Tuple + Tuple → Tuple (tuple concatenation)
-   Array + Array → Array (array concatenation)

Other types of operands are not allowed.

### Subtraction: `-`

-   Integer - Integer → Integer
-   Integer - Real → Real
-   Real - Integer → Real
-   Real - Real → Real

Other types of operands are not allowed.

### Multiplication: `*`

-   Integer \* Integer → Integer
-   Integer \* Real → Real
-   Real \* Integer → Real
-   Real \* Real → Real

Other types of operands are not allowed.

### Division: `/`

-   Integer / Integer → Integer (round down)
-   Integer / Real → Real
-   Real / Integer → Real
-   Real / Real → Real

Other types of operands are not allowed.

### Comparisons: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `=`, `/=`

-   Integer op Integer → boolean
-   Integer op Real → boolean
-   Real op Integer → boolean
-   Real op Real → boolean

Other types of operands are not allowed.

### Unary plus and minus: `+`, `-`

-   op Integer → Integer
-   op Real → Real

Other types of operands are not allowed.

### Logical operations: `and`, `or`, `xor`

Both operands must be Boolean. The result of operations is always
boolean. Other types of operands are not allowed.

### Unary negation: `not`

The operand must be Boolean. The result of the operator is boolean.
Other types of the operand are not allowed.
